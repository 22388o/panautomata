# Panautomata

This is an experimental research project to make it easy for developers to write non-trivial smart contracts which operate transparently across multiple block-chains, without having to implement the often complex and tricky underlying logic that makes it possible.

**WARNING: this is a work-in progress, use at your own risk**


## TODO

 * Tests for on-chain merkle
 * Tests for Python merkle
 * Swap example works end-to-end
 * Getting started guide


## Licensing

The project as a whole is GPL-3.0, but individual files may be licensed under the LGPL-3.0. Each file should have a `SPDX-License-Identifier` line at the start, denoting the license.
